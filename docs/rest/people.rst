GeneTrack Team
==============

The original **GeneTrack** `has been published <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btn119v1>`_  
in the **Bioinformatics** journal. The current version(**2.0**) while conceptually similar  
is a complete redesign of the software described in that paper. Notably **GeneTrack** now 
:

1. offers a data management layer where data are stored withing projects, and projects may be
   shared with other individuals who have a GeneTrack account. Data may also have other results
   attached to it, making it easy to keep track of various related files and images

2. supports visual data smoothing and peak predictions with tunable parameters. This way
   users may preview the effect of the parameter settings before executing a genome wide
   computation

3. implements an powerful visualization interface called *Track Builder* that allows 
   users may specify a wide range of visual layouts for their genomic data.
