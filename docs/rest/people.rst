GeneTrack Team
==============

The original **GeneTrack** `has been published <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btn119v1>`_  
in the **Bioinformatics** journal. The current version(**2.0**) while conceptually similar  
is a complete redesign of the software described in that paper. Notably **GeneTrack** now has
a data management layer that supports immediate visualization with tunable smoothing and multiple
peak prediction algorithms.
